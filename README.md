# About

This is a Bin Packing like problem, the strategy behind this algorithm is to find the best fit of to spread a set os numbers 
in a given amount of bin(s) and size(s). In this solution, because the shifts are variable in size 
(morning has 180mins, afternoon has 240mins), we consider the shifts as being the "bins" 
and the talk and their durations as being the packages, 
after spreading the talks in shifts, the shifts also are spread in tracks (days), following an order (morning -> afternoon -> morning..).
